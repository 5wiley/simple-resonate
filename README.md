# Resonate

Mutable Instruments Rings for the Daisy Patch programmable sound environment. 

[Ported](https://daisy.audio/DaisySP/classdaisysp_1_1Resonator/?h=resonator) by Ben Sergentanis in 2021, forked by [Tyler Reckart for the Daisy Patch](https://github.com/tylerreckart/resonate/tree/main), forked again by Tom Wiley Cotton.
Originally by Émilie Gillet

The purpose of this fork is to use Tyler Reckart's code structure to learn coding for the Daisy Seed. My goal is to have a mirror of Rings from Mutable instruments for the [Simple Designer Board](https://www.synthux.academy/simple-synth/designer). This is just a platform for installing jacks, knobs, and switches and wiring them directly into the Daisy Seed, no other analog circuitry. Therefore, any raw Daisy Seed application will work. 

Please refer to the [Rings manual](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/rings/manual/) for more details.
